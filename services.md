I handle all manner of things, but the most common services I offer are listed here. This page is mostly here to give you an idea of what I do, instead of a list of <em>all</em> that I do. You're free to sit in on any session and I'll teach you what I'm doing.

## Networking Setup
Create a custom networking solution for you. Everyone has different needs, and there's an important balance to strike between under-powered and over-kill.

## Custom PC Builds
This is one of my favorite things to do. I'll help you decide exactly what you need, starting with budget. This can be as interactive as you want it to be. I'm perfectly fine teaching you everything, or just getting the job done.

## PC Tune-up and Virus Removal
Remove viruses, update software, remove unwanted programs, and clean up your computer. This usually comes with a performance boost, but that depends on the initial state of your computer.

## Backup Solution Setup
I'll figure out the best way to back up your data. It's generally a good idea to have both on-site and off-site backups, but the size and scale depend a lot on what data you have. I'll help figure out if you need a dedicated server for backups or if you're better off$

## Laptop Repair
Replace a broken screen, a dying battery, or  worn out keyboard.

## Hardware/Software Install
Physically install or upgrade a new graphics card, hard drive, printer, or drivers. Or install a new operating systems and software.
