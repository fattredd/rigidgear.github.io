Hey. I’m Jack Butler, the owner of RigidGear LLC. I have been pursuing IT work since middle school. Although my day job is as a Software Controls Engineer, I moonlight as a friendly IT guy.
</p> <p>
I serve small businesses and individuals looking to improve their hardware. I’ve had experience working with a large assortment of installations and upgrades, and can handle anything from security cameras to enterprise networking.
</p> <p>
Aside from just completing an install, I like to teach clients how things work. Interested in learning how to build a computer? I’d love to teach you to pick the right parts, ensure upgradability, and assemble it safely.
</p> <p>
You can see what services I offer on the <a href="/services/">Services page</a>. If you’re unsure if I’m the right guy for the job, just ask! I often handle many things that aren’t listed on my website.
</p> <p>
